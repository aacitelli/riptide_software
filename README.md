The Riptide AUV Software Platform
=================================

This repository is the main codebase for the Underwater Robotics Team at The Ohio State University. Our mission is to develop the software which powers our autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) that compete in the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI) [RoboSub](https://www.auvsifoundation.org/competition/robosub) Competition in San Diego, CA. The software in this repository is built on [Robot Operating System](http://www.ros.org/) and handles low level controls, computer vision, mission-specific programs, and everything in between.

Supported Operating Systems: Ubuntu 16.04

# Initial Setup

## Cloning riptide_software
To collaborate with the `riptide_software` platform, you must fork this repo (click "Fork" at the top-right of this page). When executing the commands below, you will need to enter the URL to your forked repo. From YOUR forked repo, click "Clone or download" at the top-right of the page, copy the URL, and then insert that URL in place of `<your_forked_repo>`. Do NOT forget the `src` at the end of the last line. This is a catkin-specific requirement that all source code be placed within a folder called `src`

NOTE: It is common to see brackets such as `<>` to act as placeholders for actual code. Make sure you replace the ENTIRE phrase `<your_forked_repo>` with the URL.
```
mkdir -p ~/osu-uwrt/riptide_software/
cd ~/osu-uwrt/riptide_software/
git clone <your_forked_repo> src
```

## Setting up Git Remotes
Since you just cloned your fork to your computer, your remote called `origin` will point to your fork. Now, create a new remote called `upstream` that points to this main repo.
```
cd ~/osu-uwrt/riptide_software/src/
git remote add upstream https://github.com/osu-uwrt/riptide_software.git
```

Now, if you type:
```
git remote -v
```
You will see both a remote to your fork and to the main repo. You will use these two remotes a lot when pushing code to your fork, submitting pull-requests, and pulling the latest code.

## Installing ROS and/or Dependencies
The `riptide_software` base currently uses ROS Kinetic Kame. You will need to have ROS installed on your Ubuntu machine, along with various other dependencies, to compile the code. But don't worry, we have a setup script that will install everything for you:
```
cd ~/osu-uwrt/riptide_software/src/riptide_utilities/installation
./setup_uwrt_env.sh
```

If you already have ROS installed, but our dependencies have changed, then all you need to do is run the dependencies script (there is no need to re-run `setup_uwrt_env.sh`):
```
cd ~/osu-uwrt/riptide_software/riptide_utilities/installation
./install_dependencies.sh
```

OR, if you already know which dependency has changed, then you may search through the `riptide_utilities/installation` folder and run the desired install/setup script.

## The ~/.bashrc File
NOTE: This section is NOT required, since the setup script from above performs this action. However, it is good to verify this information is setup properly.

There are a number of environment variables (mostly pertaining to ROS features and package paths) that are required when running the code or when using the terminal. Each time you want to run one of those commands in a terminal, those environment variables will need to be set. To automate this process, we add a line to the `bashrc` file (bashrc = Born Again Shell Run-Commands) because each time a new terminal/shell is opened, it executes any commands within this file.

Open it with a terminal text editor (this is a hidden file, hence the "."):
```
nano ~/.bashrc
```
Scroll down to the bottom. Beneath the line
```
source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash
```
add the line (if not already there):
```
source ~/osu-uwrt/riptide_software/devel/setup.bash
```
To exit and save your changes, press CTRL-X, type "y", then press ENTER. Close all terminals and then re-open for changes to take effect. If you are lazy and don't want to close your terminals, then each terminal will need to be "sourced" individually to setup its environment properly. Run the command:
```
source ~/.bashrc
```

# Working with Our Other Repositories
UWRT has a few other repositories that can be used in conjunction with this one.
1. [sim_software](https://github.com/osu-uwrt/sim_software)
2. [shared_software](https://github.com/osu-uwrt/shared_software)

## Chaining Workspaces
Each of the above repositories (sim_softare, shared_software) are built on catkin as well. For the entire set of repositories to work together, we must "chain" their `setup.bash` files within the `bashrc` file for complete functionality.

Below is a complete section of code that must be placed within the `bashrc` file for ALL of our working workspaces to be chained properly. The lines pertaining to `sim_software` and `shared_software` can be omitted if the user decides not to use them. All others must remain.
```
source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash
source ~/osu-uwrt/sim_software/devel/setup.bash
source ~/osu-uwrt/shared_software/devel/setup.bash
source ~/osu-uwrt/riptide_software/devel/setup.bash
```

# Building riptide_software
ROS is compiled using the catkin build system, and so all of our repos will use catkin.

## Compiling
To compile this repo, you simply execute the `catkin_make` command from a terminal. As a word of caution, you MUST be inside the folder `~/osu-uwrt/riptide_software` to run `catkin_make`
```
cd ~/osu-uwrt/riptide_software/
catkin_make
```

In the near future, you will have to clone and compile the [control_toolbox](https://github.com/osu-uwrt/control_toolbox) because this repo will be dependent on it.

# Riptide Software Hierarchy

Below is a flow chart relating all major ROS nodes in our software base broken down by system level. Boxes with sharp corners represent physical objects (hardware, actuators), boxes with rounded corners represent individual ROS nodes, and the arrows connecting represent the direction of data communication via ROS topics.

## Primary Packages
Below is a list of the primary packages we use to run our vehicle. Feel free to click on each package to learn more about its functionality.
### [imu_3dm_gx4](https://github.com/osu-uwrt/riptide_software/tree/master/imu_3dm_gx4)
This is the driver for our [LordMicrostrain IMU 3DM-GX4](https://www.microstrain.com/inertial/3dm-gx4-25).
### [darknet_ros](https://github.com/osu-uwrt/riptide_software/tree/master/darknet_ros)
This package contains the ROS interface for the machine-learning algorithm known as [You Only Look Once (YOLO)](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) as well as the darknet source code itself.
### [riptide_msgs](https://github.com/osu-uwrt/riptide_software/tree/master/riptide_msgs)
This package only contains custom ROS messages used throughout riptide packages.
### [riptide_hardware](https://github.com/osu-uwrt/riptide_software/tree/master/riptide_hardware)
This package handles the hardware-software interface for working with all of our vehicle's sensors (data collection, data processing, etc.).
### [riptide_controllers](https://github.com/osu-uwrt/riptide_software/tree/master/riptide_controllers)
This package handles all-things controls regarding movement of the vehicle, using a system of decoupled PID controllers.
### [riptide_vision](https://github.com/osu-uwrt/riptide_software/tree/master/riptide_vision)
This package contains vision processing algorithms, such as using OpenCV to extract additional features from our camera footage, or to further process the output from darknet_ros.
### [riptide_bringup](https://github.com/osu-uwrt/riptide_software/tree/master/riptide_bringup)
This package only contains a series of launch files used to "bring-up" our vehicle. Ex. launch a mission, launch our PS3 controller, etc.
### [riptide_autonomy](https://github.com/osu-uwrt/riptide_software/tree/master/riptide_autonomy)
This package contains the RoboSub competition-specific task code. Our ultimate goal is to have a semi-autonomous system (since full autonomoy is too hard right now).

## Miscellaneous Packages
### [riptide_utilities](https://github.com/osu-uwrt/riptide_software/tree/master/riptide_utilities)
This is actually not a catkin package. This is a utility folder specific for UWRT software members for interfacing our computers with ROS and our vehicle's computer system.
### [riptide_teleop](https://github.com/osu-uwrt/riptide_software/tree/master/riptide_teleop)
This package contains the code to control the vehicle via PS3 controller.
### [riptide_description](https://github.com/osu-uwrt/riptide_software/tree/master/riptide_description)
This package contains the URDF files so we can build our vehicle in the Gazebo simulator.
